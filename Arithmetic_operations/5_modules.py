'''
next we have the modules ( % ) operator
it works on two operants and return the remainder.

Eg- suppose you have a division 10/3,then what's the remainder
    your right it would be 1..
    cause 
    10 = 3*3 + 1 (divident = divisor*quotient + remainder)
'''

# now let's have a practical demo
a=10
b=3
print(10%3 ," is the remainder")
# or 

remainder = a % b # it also does the same thing

# Taking values from user
num1=int(input("Enter a 1st number : ")) # taking 1st number from user
num2=int(input("Enter a 1st number : ")) # taking 2nd number from user

remainder= num1%num2 # getting the remainder


#----------- rest you can figure it out and it's kept as exercise--------------
